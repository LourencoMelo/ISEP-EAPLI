# Sprint B Retrospective 

# 1. Each person shares how theyâ€™re feeling following the sprint:


| Student Nr.	                   | Thoughts			 |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| **[1190718](/docs/1190718)** |      |
| **[1190782](/docs/1190782)** | 	 	   |
| **[1190811](/docs/1190811)** | It was a late start, and because of that we couldn't make things as we wanted to. Fortunately we could finished all the US and almost every requirment. But some minor error and little improvments could be done if we had more time|
| **[1191419](/docs/1191419)** | Even with the late start, the sprint went well. The core things were done properly and with care. The group environment and compatibility is great and improving. |

# 2. How we feel it went in one word:

| **[1190718](/docs/1190718)** |      |
| **[1190782](/docs/1190782)** | 	 	   |
| **[1190811](/docs/1190811)** | Great  |
| **[1191419](/docs/1191419)** | Well |

# 3. What went well:

The chemistry of the group is amazing and well-developed, thanks to the experience acquired from previous works. 
The work was well divided between the team members and everyone invested time and effort into the Sprint. The communication was good,
the team gets together often and with quality. The commits were well divided, and it's clear that everyone
contributed to the work. Everything in therms of functions of the application and client requests were fulfilled.

# 4. What went wrong and what can be improved:

After the distribution of the tasks, the team started working late on the Sprint. Because of the late start, some decisions had to be rushed and 
there was no time to make some things and refine the Sprint. There was a lack of documentation about the team's "team work", decisions making and reunions.
Also, only a few tests were made, and they weren't the most complete or correct.

In order to improve for the next Sprints, the team mainly needs to start the Sprint sooner. With more time, the flaws seen in the previous Sprint 
will not happen. Tests will be improved and more consistent documentation will not be forgotten.
