| Student Nr.	                 | Thoughts			                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[1190718](/docs/1190718)** |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **[1190782](/docs/1190782)** | This sprint went really well. This time we started to work on previous sprint problems. With this everything was perfect to continue other US's.	 	                               |
| **[1190811](/docs/1190811)** | I started to work earlier but on some improvements on the previous sprint. Because of that I couldn't begin even earlier than I wanted. At the end the implementations were done. |
| **[1191419](/docs/1191419)** | This sprint went very well. We started sooner so we had more time to perfect the US's and to make everything work.                                                                |

# 2. How we feel it went in one word:

| Student Nr.	                 | Thoughts			 |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| **[1190718](/docs/1190718)** |             |
| **[1190782](/docs/1190782)** | Fantastic	 	|
| **[1190811](/docs/1190811)** | Great       |
| **[1191419](/docs/1191419)** | Better      |

# 3. What went well:

The chemistry of the group is amazing and well-developed, thanks to the experience acquired from previous works.
The work was well divided between the team members and everyone invested time and effort into the Sprint. The communication was good,
the team gets together often and with quality. The commits were well divided, and it's clear that everyone
contributed to the work. Everything in therms of functions of the application and client requests were fulfilled.

# 4. What went wrong and what can be improved:

We think we can make better tests for the methods and functions. The part where multiple AGV's can connect to the server needs to be improved
since we only made 1 work properly with the server.

For the next Sprint we will focus on improving the AGV's -> Server situation.
